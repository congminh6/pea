{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:pea table14} calculates and generates tables of poverty and equity-related indicators for poverty analysis. It extracts data for specified countries and years, and produces a detailed table summarizing poverty and inequality measures, including poverty headcount ratio, income distribution, and equity indices. Results can be exported to Excel or saved in a specified file format.

{title:Options}

{p 4 4 2}
{opt Country(string)} specifies the country code for which the poverty indicators are to be generated.

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt Year(varname numeric)} specifies the year variable for the analysis.

{p 4 4 2}
{opt Indicator(varname)} specifies the specific indicator(s) to include in the analysis, such as poverty headcount or Gini index.

{title:Details}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:pea table14} imports relevant poverty and equity datasets, extracts the country-specific and region-specific data for the selected year, and generates a table with:
  - Poverty headcount ratios (e.g., at $1.90 and $3.20 poverty lines)
  - Gini coefficients
  - Theil indices
  - Distributional indices like the Palma ratio
  - Additional poverty and inequality measures with contextual information (e.g., inequality thresholds).

{p 4 4 2}  
The final output is a comprehensive summary table ordered by the specified indicator(s), with results available for immediate reporting. Results can be exported to Excel if the `excel` option is used, or saved in a specified file format.

{title:Example}

{p 4 4 2}
To generate the poverty and equity analysis table for a specific country and year, and export the results to an Excel file:

{cmd:. pea_table14, Country(GHA) Year(year) Indicator(PovertyHeadcount) excel(output_table14.xlsx)}
