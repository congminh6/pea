{title:Syntax}

{p 4 15}
{cmd:pea table9} 
[{cmd:if} {it:exp}] 
[{cmd:in} {it:exp}] 
[{cmd:,} 
  {opt Country(string)} 
  {opt Year(varname numeric)} 
  {opt CORE setting(string)} 
  {opt excel(string)}
  {opt save(string)}]{p_end}

{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:pea_table9} calculates and generates tables of vision-related indicators from the World Bank Scorecard. It extracts country-specific and region-specific indicators, including key economic and social measures, and produces an ordered table for use in reporting. The results can be exported to an Excel file.

{title:Options}
  
  {phang} {opt Country(string)} specifies the country code for which the indicators are to be generated.
  
  {phang} {opt Year(varname numeric)} specifies the year variable for the analysis.
  
  {phang} {opt CORE setting(string)} specifies custom settings, such as region or data type.
  
  {phang} {opt excel(string)} specifies the file path for exporting results to Excel. If omitted, results are saved to a temporary file.
 
  {phang} {opt save(string)} specifies the file path for saving intermediate data.

{title:Details}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:pea_table9} imports multiple Scorecard Vision Indicator files, extracts the relevant country and region data, and generates a table that includes:
  
	  - Indicator names and codes
	  - Country and region data for the latest year available
	  - Additional context such as year of the data for country and region, and whether indicators meet certain thresholds (e.g., high inequality based on Gini coefficient).

{p 4 4 2}  
The final output is a table summarizing the indicators, ordered by predefined categories. The program supports exporting the results to an Excel file if the `excel` option is specified, or saves the results in a temporary file by default.

{title:Example}

{p 4 4 2}
To generate the Scorecard Vision Indicators table for a specific country and year, and export the results to an Excel file:

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:. pea_table9, Country("GHA") Year(year) excel("output_table9.xlsx")}
