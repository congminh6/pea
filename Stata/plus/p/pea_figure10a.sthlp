{title:Description}  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt pea_figure10a} generates a visualization of **Figure 10a: Prosperity Gap by Year Lines**. This visualization allows users to analyze trends in income distribution and poverty across urban/rural populations over time.  

{p 4 4 2} 
The program computes scatter points representing trends in poverty gaps and creates connecting visualizations across years to highlight temporal comparisons. Users can optionally group by urban/rural classifications, adjust visualization settings, or perform comparability adjustments over specified survey years.

{title:Options}  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt ONEWelfare(varname numeric)}:  
Specifies the variable representing the numeric welfare measure for analysis, such as income, consumption, or wealth.  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt Year(varname numeric)}: 
Specifies the numeric variable that represents the time periods for the visualization analysis (e.g., survey years).  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt urban(varname numeric)}: 
Specifies the urban/rural grouping variable for the analysis.  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt comparability(string)}:
Defines criteria for comparing survey years across periods. Only observations meeting these criteria are visualized.  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt NONOTES}:  
Suppresses explanatory notes in the visualization.  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt EQUALSPACING}:  
Ensures that the visualization represents time intervals as evenly spaced, even in the presence of gaps.  

{p 4 4 2}
{opt yrange0}: Optional. When specified, the y-axis starts at 0.

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt scheme(string)}:  
Specifies the visualization scheme (e.g., `viridis`, `rainbow`, etc.).  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt palette(string)}: 
Defines a custom color palette for visual clarity and distinction among groups or survey periods.  

{p 4 4 2}  
{opt save(string)}:  
Specifies the file path to save the processed results.  

{p 4 4 2} 
{opt excel(string)}: 
Exports visualization and calculated trends into Excel for external analysis.  

{title:Remarks}  

{p 4 4 2}
The {opt pea_figure10a} program performs temporal visual analysis of urban vs rural trends in prosperity gaps over specified years.  

{p 4 4 2}
The visualization represents scatter points for each urban/rural group over time and connects them based on trends between years.  

{p 4 4 2}
Options such as `comparability`, `scheme`, and `EQUALSPACING` provide users flexibility in comparing survey years or customizing visual outputs.
