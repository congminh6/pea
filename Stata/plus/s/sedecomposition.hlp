{title:Description}

{p}{cmd:sedecomposition} A change in poverty between two dates could be decomposed into three components:
The {it:Intra-sectoral component} shows the contribution of poverty changes within the sector, controlling for
their base period population share. The {it:Population-shift} component tells us how much of the poverty in the
first data was reduced by the various changes in population shares of sectors between then and the second date.
The {it:Interaction} component arise from the possible correlation between sectoral gains and population
shift, the sign of the interaction effect tells us whether people tented to switch to the sectors where
poverty was falling or not.
{p_end}

{p}{cmd:sedecomposition} uses observations from the dataset currently in memory (the master dataset)
and observations from the Stata-format dataset stored as {it:file1} (using dataset).{p_end}


{title:Options}

{p 0 4} {it:file1} is a file with a second year data. This file should contain the welfare
 indicator variable (e.g., expenditure or income) and all the variables the are used in
in {cmd:if} and/or {cmd:weight} statements. That file must be specified.  If filename is specified without an
extension, .dta is assumed. In order to run {cmd:sedecomposition} you should have open one of
the files with data.{p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmd:var1} is a welfare indicator variable in the first year data. This variable
should be present in the opened file. This variable must be specified together with {cmd:pline1} variable.
This variable should not be specified if {cmd:poor1} variable is specified. {p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmd:var2} is a welfare indicator variable in the second year data. This variable
should be present in the {cmd:using} file. This variable must be specified together with {cmd:pline2} variable.
This variable should not be specified if {cmd:poor2} variable is specified.{p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmd:pline1} is a poverty line for the first year of data. This poverty line can be
specified either as a number as a variable that contains the value corresponding to the poverty line in the first date.
This variable must be specified together with {cmd:welf1} variable. This variable should not be specified if {cmd:poor1} variable is specified.
{p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmd:pline2} is a poverty line for the first year of data. This poverty line can be
specified either as a number as a variable that contains the value corresponding to the poverty line in the second date.
This variable must be specified together with {cmd:welf2} variable.This variable should not be specified if {cmd:poor2} variable is specified.
{p_end}

{p 0 4} {cmd:hc}, {cmd:pg}, {cmd:pgs} are optional indicators of the poverty measure to be decomposed. If {cmd:hc}
is specified the poverty head count (FGT_0) decomposition will be performed. Specifying {cmd:pg} or {cmd:pgs} will
produce sectoral decomposiiton of poverty gap or squared poverty gap, respectivly. If none of these options
is specified, head count decomposition will be performed.
